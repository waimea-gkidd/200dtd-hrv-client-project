# Relevant Implications

## Usability Implications

Getting Things Done Quickly and Easily.

### Relevance to the System

The system needs to be very simple and intuitive so my father can quickly add notes, schedule meetings, and find client info without hassle.
### Impact / Considerations

The app should have a clean, easy-to-use interface with minimal steps to complete tasks. Avoid clutter and unnecessary features.



## Functionality Implications

The app must support multiple pages: client profiles, meeting scheduler, client info table, and follow-ups.

### Relevance to the System

Each page will serve a clear purpose to keep all client data organized and easy to access.

### Impact / Considerations

Need to ensure smooth navigation between pages and reliable data storage in a database for future reference.

A simple design will help avoid distractions and make it easier to use daily.

### Impact / Considerations

Choose a basic color scheme and readable fonts, with consistent layout across pages.


## End-User Implications

The app will be used only by my father for his personal client notes and scheduling.

### Relevance to the System

Since itâ€™s a single user, the app can be customized for his specific workflow.

### Impact / Considerations

Keep the app personalized and straightforward without needing complex user management or permissions.


## Privacy Implications

Client data will be stored locally or securely in a database only accessible to my father.

### Relevance to the System

Client confidentiality is important, so data should be protected from unauthorized access.

Use clear labels, large enough fonts, and keyboard navigation support where possible.
